Test Entry

This entry is to test out my automatic Python script for pulling the git repo into a temporary
folder, making an edit by calling nvim, and then committing and pushing the result back.  Let's
see if it works!

First Entry

This entry is more of a test if anything, just to get things going and have something to upload.  
I don't really like blogging or anything like that, so I thought that a resurrection of a "finger"
server would be more interesting, as it's simple and more open-ended.  Let's see how it goes.
