It's been a while since I've updated.  Every time I get ready to update, it's generally at 
the end of my worktime, which I have done deep into the night, so sleep takes precedence :D

I've been working on my next project.  I'm not quite ready to say what it is, but what I can say
is that it involves some low level reverse-engineering and some rebuilding of said reverse-engineered
algorithms in a newer language.  There are 2 parts to the program that I am reverse-engineering, and
I know that one of them will be rebuilt in Go.

I'm enjoying Go so far: it has the intuitivity of Python but runs natively and has a better concept
of abstraction and composition, as it wasn't "tacked on" later.  I find that with only a few core
concepts, such as how to define variables and some things with interfaces, I am writing code very fluidly
without many breaks to look up syntax.

I want to, in the future, get a Docker container going for my development environment, as 
then I can control everything on it without screwing up my main development machine.I'll get that sorted at
some point, right now I'm too into the code :D

I spent the week trying to sort out the bug where it saves to the local disk when we are
preparing an update.  I don't want anything saved to the disk, but I want the buffer to be
modifiable so that its contents can be piped into the update.py script.

The most obvious thought that came to me, unbeknowest of vim's option sets for buffers, was
to simply store all the modifiable files in a temporary directory, so when vim or any autosave
plugin wants to save, it will just save to a hidden folder without much fuss.  This seemed relatively
straightforward to implement, except it needed a bit of help from the Python side.

When a buffer is fetched, instead of the raw text being returned, the text is saved to a temporary file
and then the path to that file is returned instead of the data.  I liked this idea, but I didn't like
the Python scripts having to know or care about files...they should only care about the data they either
fetch or push, and anything that wants to manipulate that data should create a mechanism to do so.

I then thought of the gitdotplan.nvim plugin having an extra Python script that is called by the plugin
to perform the actions of fetching and updating.  This script could call the regular Python scripts when
it needs to do something, and then create a temporary directory, save the fetched data to that directory,
and return the path.  Then, the NVIM plugin simply has to open that path and it can do what it likes.

I felt this would work, but it was a bit much for something that seemed like it should be obvious to do in
an editor: make a buffer non-saveable to a file.  Luckily, after some quick searching on buffer options,
I found what I needed!

vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(current_buffer_update_number, "buftype", "nofile")
vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(current_buffer_update_number, "modifiable", true)

This will make the buffer modifiable, but NVIM will not save it whenever a save is called, as it is disassociating
itself from whatever file it may have had.

The test now is to see how it works with this update :D

Update: It worked!  I feel like this plugin is now ready for general use, so if there is a need in the future,
I'll jump back to it.

Document plugin in README.md
Document base Python code in README.md
+ Don't save the update files to disk

----------------------------------------

I have updating working via the plugin, which is awesome.  Right now, I feel like I can
use this thing I've made as I want to use it; I can't wait to have it open while I'm working
on another project and just typing out an update while looking at the project code for reference...

I need some sort of alert to indicate that the buffer has not been updated.  It seems to not autosave
the buffer, which is good, so maybe the alert when exiting will be good enough?  I have that and
some other polish ideas in mind, so I need to just fix as I go, which doubles as testing.

+ Perform gitdotplan file update

Better error messages
Don't save the update files to disk

The update worked via the plugin!  However my original post-update post was never updated...
Here is another test for posterity :D

This is a test to see if updating via the plugin works!  Let's see...

I got a bit more work done today; I find the biggest challenge is figuring out
how to do seemingly simple things in Lua like concatenate arrays...

I'm feeling like I'm almost there with a full plugin as well, with some nitpicks
and polish required to make the editing experience better.

* The updater no longer creates the file you wish to update if it isn't there

* The updater now parses a git repo regardless of if it is short or long

* The plugin now opens the specified finger or edit in a new buffer in 
  the current window

* The plugin can fetch an update text and load it in non-readonly mode

* Changed the name of the plugin parameter for the repo to update

Perform gitdotplan file update

Set formatting in gitdotplan buffer to string wrap and such, like GITCOMMIT

Validate that the gitdotplan repo to update is writeable

March 15th, 2025 - Continued
----------------------------

* Utility method to run a subprocess, with a cwd option and a hide_output
  option

* Better error checking for git commands for both programs, 
  and the EDITOR command for the updater

* Git repo isn't hardcoded anymore

* Use either a "short" repo or the full URL to the repo as a command
  line parameter

Finger script written

I wrote the script to fetch someone's gitdotplan files, known back in the day as "fingering"
a user on a server.  The script wasn't too bad, I just had to re-use the same git cloning code
that I had written for the updating, but then read the files instead of writing them.  In preparation
for my future nvim plugin, I included some arguments to pass in to read individual files, like the
.plan file or the .project file.  This will allow me to run a read command to get the buffer to edit
for nvim, and then run the update command to update the file, as I also included the same parameters
in the updater script as well.

I tossed around the idea of allowing any file to be fetched or edited, but did not go that route.
The reason I didn't want to was that I am implementing something that had a set of files already,
and the featureset in that regard has no reason to change.  I therefore used an enum to represent
the possible files.

I need to do a little more polish, checking error codes, etc. for both the finger and update scripts,
and then I can proceed with the nvim plugin.

First pass at a script

I wrote a Python script today to add some automation to my .plan file editing, without having to
always go into my repo itself.  This allows me in future to write an editor plugin that can edit
the existing buffer and then pipe the output to this Python script to perform the update.

The way that it works is pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the git repo pointing to my "fingerserver" into a temporary directory. 
   Right now this is hardcoded to my own repo.

2. Check if we have piped input.  If we do, then set our new file contents to whatever is in stdin

3. If we don't have piped input, launch nvim with the cloned file in the temporary directory for editing,
   and once finished, read the updated file into our file data variable.

4. Update the cloned .plan file with our file data variable.  Yes, this is roundabout with the editor launching,
   but the editor is temporary and I wanted to get as much of the code flow in as possible right now

5. Commit the update with the current date and time and push it back to the remote repo

Not too bad, I'm using it for this update as well.

The next steps are some customization of the repo URL, and an nvim plugin so we can remove the manual editor
launch.

First Entry

This entry is more of a test if anything, just to get things going and have something to upload.  
I don't really like blogging or anything like that, so I thought that a resurrection of a "finger"
server would be more interesting, as it's simple and more open-ended.  Let's see how it goes.
