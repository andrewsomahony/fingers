First pass at a script

I wrote a Python script today to add some automation to my .plan file editing, without having to
always go into my repo itself.  This allows me in future to write an editor plugin that can edit
the existing buffer and then pipe the output to this Python script to perform the update.

The way that it works is pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the git repo pointing to my "fingerserver" into a temporary directory. 
   Right now this is hardcoded to my own repo.

2. Check if we have piped input.  If we do, then set our new file contents to whatever is in stdin

3. If we don't have piped input, launch nvim with the cloned file in the temporary directory for editing,
   and once finished, read the updated file into our file data variable.

4. Update the cloned .plan file with our file data variable.  Yes, this is roundabout with the editor launching,
   but the editor is temporary and I wanted to get as much of the code flow in as possible right now

5. Commit the update with the current date and time and push it back to the remote repo

Not too bad, I'm using it for this update as well.

The next steps are some customization of the repo URL, and an nvim plugin so we can remove the manual editor
launch.

First Entry

This entry is more of a test if anything, just to get things going and have something to upload.  
I don't really like blogging or anything like that, so I thought that a resurrection of a "finger"
server would be more interesting, as it's simple and more open-ended.  Let's see how it goes.
